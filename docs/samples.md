The generated script can be called as a stand alone Python script, it can also be edited to achieve results others than the ones available with the default pipeline structure


## Tomato side view
This example shows how a class pipeline works, to execute it just select the "Default process" tool from the "Tools/Execute default process" menu after selection the tomato plant sample.
