# Pipelines

In this section we're going to build a fully functioning pipeline starting from scratch using the tools provided by IPSO Phen. Among these tools only some of them can be integrated into pipelines they are:

!!! note
    Some tools may be present in more than one category.

- **Exposure fixing**: Fix image exposure, the resulting image will be used for color analysis
- **Feature extraction**: Tools to extract features from a segmented image
- **Mask cleanup**: Cleans a coarse mask generated by threshold tools
- **Pre-processing**: Transform the image to help segmentation, the image may not retain it's properties.  Changes here will be ignored when extracting features
- **ROI (dynamic)**: Create a ROI after analyzing the image
- **ROI (static)**: Create a ROI from coordinates
- **Threshold**: Threshold tools
- **White balance**: Tools to help change white balance, depending on where those tools are set in the pipeline they or may not be ignored when extracting features

!!! note
    Normally, we would run test on a random set of images before adding a tool to the pipeline. I usually run tests on a random selection of a 100 images while building the pipeline and on about a 1000 images when the pipeline is ready.

## Pipeline save formats

All files generated by in the tutorial are available in the *sample_pipelines* and *class_pipelines* folders

### Binary file *.tipp

Default binary format, non human readable.

### JSON

Equivalent to binary format but human readable. always backup your pipelines in this format in case backwards compatibility is broken.

### Python script

Finally a pipeline can be saved as a fully functioning Python script. This is so advanced users can modify it at wish. Python knowledge is required.
