# First steps

## Loading images

Since IPSO Phen is high throughput oriented it parses full folders instead of loading single files.

!!! warning
    Parsing is recursive, ie images in all sub folders will be added to the catalog.

To add images to the file manager open the *File* menu and select *Parse folders*. More on adding files in the [user interface](user_interface.md) section

## Tools

- All tools can be accessed through the "Tools" menu
- They're classified by their type
- One tool can have multiple types
- Existing types:  
    - **Ancillary**: Tools mostly used inside other tools
    - **Clustering**: Clustering tools
    - **Demo**: Demo tools, start here if you want to understand how to create/edit tools
    - **Execute default class pipeline**: Execute a class pipeline linked to the selected image experiment, if no class pipeline is available an error will be reported
    - **Exposure fixing**: Fix image exposure, the resulting image will be used for color analysis
    - **Feature extraction**: Tools to extract features from a segmented image
    - **Image checking**: Check different aspects of an image
    - **Image info**: Gives info about the current image
    - **Image generator**: Creates one or more images from a selected image
    - **Mask cleanup**: Cleans a coarse mask generated by threshold tools
    - **Pre-processing**: Transform the image to help segmentation, the image may not retain it's properties. Changes here will be ignored when extracting features
    - **ROI (dynamic)**: Create a ROI after analyzing the image
    - **ROI (static)**: Create a ROI from coordinates
    - **Threshold**: Threshold tools
    - **Visualization**: Visualization tools
    - **White balance**: Tools to help change white balance, depending on where those tools are set in the pipeline they or may not be ignored when extracting features
- Upon selecting a tool the help tab and the tool interface is updated
- If the tool reacts in real time the result will be displayed on the "Output image" tab, if not you need to click on the play button next to "Use pipeline as preprocessor"

## Pipelines

- The following types of tools can be added to pipelines through the "Pipeline" menu:
    - Exposure fixing
    - Feature extraction
    - Mask cleanup
    - Pre-processing
    - ROI (dynamic)
    - ROI (static)
    - Threshold
- Once a pipeline is loaded its components appear on the "Pipeline" tab in the bottom left part of the UI
- Pipelines can be saved/loaded through the "Pipeline" menu
- Pipeline options can be configured on the pipeline tab
- To Execute a pipeline click the "play" button on the "Pipeline" tab
- Pipelines can be executed on all the images present on the quick access list in the "Pipeline processor" tab

## Testing

- At any time a test run can be executed on all or part of the images present in the quick access list by clicking on the "Play" button next to "Batch process" at the bottom left of the UI
- Three test modes are available:
    - **"All"**: Will test all images in the quick access list, this will ignore the spin box
    - **"First n"**: Test the first **n** images, **n** refers to the number displayed in the spin box
    - **"Random n"**: Test **n** random images, **n** refers to the number displayed in the spin box

## Building image data file

### Launching the analysis

Once a pipeline is ready it can be executed on any number of images in the "Pipeline processor" tab. Options can be set before launching the mass process, only thread count, which the number of images processed at the same time can be modified afterwards.

### Progress feedback

Once the process starts, the progress can be viewed on the "Log" tab. At any time the process can be stopped, afterwards, if the process is restarted the already analysed images will be skipped (partial results are stored) unless the setting to overwrite is checked.

### CSV file

After the all the images are analysed, a CSV file will be generated in the selected output folder.
