### Filtering regional maxima
From scikit image - Filtering regional maxima: Perform a morphological reconstruction of an image.  
Morphological reconstruction by dilation is similar to basic morphological dilation: high-intensity values will replace nearby low-intensity values. The basic dilation operator, however, uses a structuring element to determine how far a value in the input image can spread. In contrast, reconstruction uses two images: a "seed" image, which specifies the values that spreads, and a "mask" image, which gives the maximum allowed value at each pixel. The mask image, like the structuring element, limits the spread of high-intensity values. Reconstruction by erosion is simply the inverse: low-intensity values spread from the seed image and are limited by the mask image, which represents the minimum allowed value.  
Alternatively, you can think of reconstruction as a way to isolate the connected regions of an image. For dilation, reconstruction connects regions marked by local maxima in the seed image: neighboring pixels less-than-or-equal-to those seeds are connected to the seeded region.  
Local maxima with values larger than the seed image will get truncated to the seed value.

### Hysteresis threshold
From scikit-image: Apply hysteresis thresholding to image.  
This algorithm finds regions where image is greater than high OR image is greater than low and that region is connected to a region greater than high.  
In other words, a pixel is accepted if its value is greater than the upper threshold, or its value is higher than the lower threshold and one of has already been accepted.

### Niblack binarization
Niblack binarization: From skimage - Applies Niblack local threshold to an array. A threshold T is calculated for every pixel in the image using the following formula:T = m(x,y) - k * s(x,y) where m(x,y) and s(x,y) are the mean and standard deviation of pixel (x,y) neighborhood defined by a rectangular window with size w times w centered around the pixel. k is a configurable parameter that weights the effect of standard deviation.

### Sauvola binarization
Sauvola binarization: From skimage - Applies Sauvola local threshold to an array.  
Sauvola is a modification of Niblack technique.In the original method a threshold T is calculated for every pixel in the image using the following formula:T = m(x,y) * (1 + k * ((s(x,y) / R) - 1))where m(x,y) and s(x,y) are the mean and standard deviation of pixel (x,y)neighborhood defined by a rectangular window with size w times w centered around the pixel. k is a configurable parameter that weights the effect of standard deviation. R is the maximum standard deviation of a greyscale image.
