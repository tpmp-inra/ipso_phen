### Filtering regional maxima
From scikit image - Filtering regional maxima: Perform a morphological reconstruction of an image.<br>Morphological reconstruction by dilation is similar to basic morphological dilation: high-intensity values willreplace nearby low-intensity values. The basic dilation operator, however, uses a structuring element todetermine how far a value in the input image can spread. In contrast, reconstruction uses two images: a "seed"image, which specifies the values that spread, and a "mask" image, which gives the maximum allowed value ateach pixel. The mask image, like the structuring element, limits the spread of high-intensity values.Reconstruction by erosion is simply the inverse: low-intensity values spread from the seed image and arelimited by the mask image, which represents the minimum allowed value.<br>Alternatively, you can think of reconstruction as a way to isolate the connected regions of an image.For dilation, reconstruction connects regions marked by local maxima in the seed image: neighboring pixelsless-than-or-equal-to those seeds are connected to the seeded region.<br>Local maxima with values larger than the seed image will get truncated to the seed value.<br>
